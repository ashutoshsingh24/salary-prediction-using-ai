## 📂 Dataset

A small demo dataset is used:

| Years of Experience | Salary (₹)   |
|---------------------|--------------|
| 12                  | 63,248.04    |
| 21                  | 97,541.39    |
| 25                  | 106,959.80   |
| 26                  | 125,038.02   |
| 28                  | 132,126.46   |

> You can replace or extend this with larger datasets (e.g., from Kaggle) for more robust predictions.
